      <description>Access Control We aim for: Principle of Least Privilege.
Limit the damage of an accident Reduce interaction to the minimum operator Minimized the number of the program audited. ( e.g: My office key can only open my office door. )
( e.g: Classified information of &amp;ldquo;need-to-know&amp;rdquo; )
Models and Policies Security Model
Subject (Who); Apps, Users, Web Origins Objects (What): Files, Processes, Devices, DB Tables, Cookies Operations: Read, Write, Call This security model defines an Access Control Matrix.</description>

      <description>This is my second day of the KubeCon Event. I love KubeCon. The opening keynote of KubeCon | CloudNativeCon
KubeCon supports Ukrain
Definitely Something I will need: Kubernetes tutorial
Border between US and Canada
Best activity today: Solution Showcase. A varierty of product from dozens of companies
This is a lovely microK8s cluster built with 4 Raspberry Pi and a switch
The impact of Prometheus. We should use Prometheus to get data in order to utilize our resources as much as possible</description>

      <description>This is the first time I have ever paid a visit to a formal academic conference
My Badge of KubeCon
Conference about In-Time data analysis
A nice fuzz generator that can generate random test cases to make your program robust
A high schooler sharing his ideas about open-source development
Gavin said that it reminded him of his high school age.
An online encyclopedia for Cloud Native terminology
I think I will try it.</description>

      <description>Threat Model Alice computes v=f(m), where v is a verifier of the message m. Alice sends the message to Bob via Mallory. Bob verifies that v&#39;=f(m&#39;). Random Function (RF) Set up a random map f: {Fixed size input}-&amp;gt;{Fixed size output}. This function is only known by Alice and Bob, but unknown to Mallory.
Provably secure: Mallory cannot find out the verifier of a message that he has never seen (he cannot do it better than guessing).</description>

      <description>Project Description The project was created at the request of Professor Manuel Charlemagne of Shanghai Jiaotong University. We expect the website to demonstrate the masterpieces created by our students in a web game development course. The website is designed to automatically fetch, deploy and demonstrate the student projects. I am currently in charge of leading the general development process.
The website is currently hosted at: https://focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/silverfocs/. The accessibility from the US depends on the network status of Shanghai Jiaotong University.</description>

      <description>This is a remake of the first version of Legend of Zelda released by Nintendo in 1986 on NES. This remake includes a revision of the original Dungeon level and most of the core mechanics shipped with the game.
We also added a few new features to the game. I want to keep it a secret here. You can play and explore it all by yourself.
Press X to use your sword and Z to use your alternative weapon (exactly what it was in the original NES game).</description>

      <description>How to play How to play this 2-player platform puzzle game? Use WASD for one player and arrow keys for the other. (Sorry I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to implement game controller support)
What&amp;rsquo;s new The most interesting part of a platform puzzle game is that the 2 players should cooperate as much as possible! They should think hard together to find a path. In this game, I introduced a new way to cooperate: the players can switch their colors and therefore, their abilities to pass the levels.</description>

      <description>The Jaseci Mission The mission of Jaseci is to accelerate and democratize the development and deployments of end-to-end scalable AI applications. To this end, Jaseci presents a novel set of higher level abstractions for programming sophisticated software in a micro-service/serverless AI and a full stack architecture and programming model that abstracts away and automates much of the complexity of building applications on a distributed compute substrate of potentially thousands of compute nodes.</description>

      <description>What is this Calypso is a game that we submitted as our project for the game development and management course called VG100 at Shanghai Jiaotong University. It is an exploration game where the player can walk around and interact with NPCs. The entire game is a single-page web application written in Elm.
Technical ELM: A newly-introduced functional programming language Git: Basic skills to manipulate git repositories Project Management: When starting a project, coding comes last: Otherwise, we may waste our efforts on useless development.</description>
