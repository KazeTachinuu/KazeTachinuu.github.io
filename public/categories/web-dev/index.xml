      <description>Project Description The project was created at the request of Professor Manuel Charlemagne of Shanghai Jiaotong University. We expect the website to demonstrate the masterpieces created by our students in a web game development course. The website is designed to automatically fetch, deploy and demonstrate the student projects. I am currently in charge of leading the general development process.
The website is currently hosted at: https://focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/silverfocs/. The accessibility from the US depends on the network status of Shanghai Jiaotong University.</description>

It is an exploration game where the player can walk around and interact with NPCs. The entire game is a single-page web application written in Elm.
Technical ELM: A newly-introduced functional programming language Git: Basic skills to manipulate git repositories Project Management: When starting a project, coding comes last: Otherwise, we may waste our efforts on useless development.</description>
