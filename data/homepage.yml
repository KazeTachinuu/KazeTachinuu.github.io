      title: "Jaseci: A Programming Paradigm and Runtime Stack for Building Scale-out Production Applications Easy and Fast"
      description: The mission of Jaseci is to accelerate and democratize the development and deployments of end-to-end scalable AI applications. To this end, Jaseci presents a novel set of higher level abstractions for programming sophisticated software in a micro-service/serverless AI and a full stack architecture and programming model that abstracts away and automates much of the complexity of building applications on a distributed compute substrate of potentially thousands of compute nodes. The design of Jaseci includes two major innovations. The submission is still pending.
