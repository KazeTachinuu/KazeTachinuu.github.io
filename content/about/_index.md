Hi! I'm Hugo, a second year Computer Engineer student from EPITA, France. 
I like doing personal projects, which you will find in the portfolio page of this website. 
My specialties can be found on the homepage.

I am currently looking for a 3 years internship starting September 2024, in the field of cyber security, especially in the offensive side of it, penetration testing, red teaming, etc.
