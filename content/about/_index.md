## Who am I

Hi! I am Hugo Sibony. I am a second year undergraduate student from EPITA, school of Computer Engineering, majoring in CyberSecurity. 

## My Education Experiences

I'm an undergraduate studying cybersecurity in Singapore as part of an exchange program. I'm also creating a startup, Prometech, with a friend. We're trying to create new tools using AI for computing, for example my latest project is a tool that uses reinforcement learning to do pentesting.
## My Interests

I am interested in CyberSecurity, AI, and entrepreneurship. I am also interested in the intersection of these fields, for example using AI to improve CyberSecurity. I like to do Capture the Flag from time to time.
