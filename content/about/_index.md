## Who am I

Hi! I am Hugo Sibony. I am a second year undergraduate student from <a href="https://www.epita.fr/">EPITA, school of Computer Engineering</a>, majoring in CyberSecurity. Currently working in a 36 months work-study program (internship) in CyberSecurity.

## My Education Experiences

I'm an undergraduate studying cybersecurity. I'm also creating a startup, <a href="https://codetruefalse.github.io/">TrueFalse</a>, with a friend.<br>We're trying to create new tools using AI for cybersecurity, for example my latest project is a tool that uses reinforcement learning to do pentesting.

In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to do go to Berkeley as part of their Summer Sessions.
During this summer, I took 2 classes, one on <a href="https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2023-summer-compsci-61a-001-lec-001">Computer Science (CS 61A)</a> and one on <a href="https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2023-summer-math-n1a-001-lec-001">Mathematics (MATH N1A)</a>.
<br>
Feel free my report on my experience at Berkeley <a href="/Berkeley.pdf">here</a>.


After that, as part of an exchange program, I went to <a href="https://www.jcu.edu.sg/">James Cook University Singapore</a> for a semester. I took 4 classes there, one on Ethical Hacking, one on Network Security, one on Programming in Java and one on Data Mining.
<br>
Feel free to read my report on my experience at JCU <a href="/JCU.pdf">here</a>.
## My Interests

I am interested in CyberSecurity, I'm currently learning about blue teaming, Network Security. I like to do Capture the Flag from time to time.

I also like to do some programming, I'm currently doing some open source projects, you can find them on my <a href="https://github.com/KazeTachinuu">Github</a> or on my <a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a>.
