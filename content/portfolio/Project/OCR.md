# Rainfall Analyser / Visualizer


This is a coursework for my Java course at JCU. 

I have to implement a rainfall analyser that can read data from a csv file and output the result to another file. 

I also implemented a visualizer that can visualize the rainfall data in a bar chart.

We had to build a GUI for this project using JavaFX.


## Features

- Read data from a csv file
- Visualize the rainfall data in a bar chart

The GUI allows the user to select a csv file. It will then read the data from the csv file and analyse it.

The user can also visualize the rainfall data in a bar chart.
