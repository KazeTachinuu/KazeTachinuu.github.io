# Track

Track is a cloud-based scraping tool that allows you to scrape data from any website and send it to your Discord server.

Click on the logo to go to the project's website.

## How does it work?

Track uses Discord Webhooks to send the data to Prometech's servers, which then sends it to your Discord server.

## How do I use it?

You can contact me on Discord (@hugosib) to get a Track instance for your server. 

The price is **15â‚¬ per month per website scraped**.
