# Rainfall Analyser / Visualizer

## Why this project

This is a coursework for my Java course at JCU. I have to implement a rainfall analyser that can read data from a csv file and output the result to another file. I also implemented a visualizer that can visualize the rainfall data in a bar chart.
We had to build a GUI for this project, but I decided to use JavaFX.


## Features

- Read data from a csv file
- Output the result to another file
- Visualize the rainfall data in a bar chart
