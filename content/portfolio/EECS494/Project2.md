## How to play

How to play this 2-player platform puzzle game? Use WASD for one player and arrow keys for the other. (Sorry I don't have enough time to implement game controller support)

## What's new

The most interesting part of a platform puzzle game is that the 2 players should cooperate as much as possible! They should think hard together to find a path. In this game, I introduced a new way to cooperate: the players can switch their colors and therefore, their abilities to pass the levels.
