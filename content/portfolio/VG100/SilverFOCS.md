## Project Description
The project was created at the request of Professor Manuel Charlemagne of Shanghai Jiaotong University. We expect the website to demonstrate the masterpieces created by our students in a web game development course. The website is designed to automatically fetch, deploy and demonstrate the student projects. I am currently in charge of leading the general development process.

The website is currently hosted at: https://focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/silverfocs/. The accessibility from the US depends on the network status of Shanghai Jiaotong University.

## Skills Used
In this project, we used ELM, a new front-end language, to build the appearance of the entire website. The entire website is well-designed to be a single-page application so that the browser does not need to reload the all components when accessing different pages of the website.

The backend is written in Python Flask. It automatically handles the submissions from our students.
